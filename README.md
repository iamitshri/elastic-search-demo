# Elastic search demo using springboot
- This project shows how to wire Rest High level Client with spring-data-elasticsearch project. It may change in future with spring data releases.


## For this demo I have used
-  aws elasticsearch service (without authentication/authorization) (6.4.x)
-  Local elastic search (6.4.x)

### Getting setup locally 
- Install Elasticsearch https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-4-3
- Install Kibana https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/kibana-6-4-3 ( This is not required but useful to playwith indexed data)
